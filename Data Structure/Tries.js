/* Trie Data Structure :

- A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is similar to a graph, but with some specific properties and constraints. Here's an explanation of the tree data structure:

- Nodes: A tree is composed of nodes, where each node represents a distinct element or entity. Each node in a tree can have zero or more child nodes, except for the root node, which is the topmost node and has no parent.

- Root: The root is the topmost node of the tree and serves as the starting point for traversing or accessing the tree. There is only one root node in a tree.

- Parent and Child: Each node in a tree, except the root, has a parent node. A node directly connected to another node is called its child, and the node it is connected from is called its parent. Nodes that share the same parent are called siblings.

- Leaf: A leaf is a node in a tree that does not have any children. In other words, a leaf node is a node that has a degree of 0, meaning it has no outgoing edges.

- Path: A path in a tree is a sequence of nodes connected by edges. It represents the route from one node to another node in the tree.

- Depth and Height: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node. The height of a tree is the maximum depth among all the nodes in the tree.

- Binary Tree: A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are commonly used and have various applications in computer science.

- Trees are widely used for organizing hierarchical data and solving problems that involve hierarchical relationships. Some common applications of trees include file systems, organization charts, family trees, parsing expressions, and implementing various data structures and algorithms like binary search trees, AVL trees, and heaps.

- Traversing a tree can be done using various algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Tree structures can be implemented using various techniques, including linked lists, arrays, or a combination of both, depending on the specific requirements and desired operations.
